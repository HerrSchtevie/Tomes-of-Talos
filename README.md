## 📌 Introduction

Tomes of Talos is a lore-rich, SFW Skyrim modlist spun from the foundations of Journals of Jyggalag, designed to deliver a stable, immersive, and cohesive experience focused on storytelling, exploration, and visual fidelity. Every addition has been hand-picked to enhance Skyrim's atmosphere without breaking its lore or tone.

## 📋 Features

- **Four Unique Profiles Included:**  
  TOT offers two distinct profiles tailored to your preferred experience:  
  - **Lord's Vision** – Cabbage ENB﻿, Full graphics, and all features enabled  
  - **Performance** – Community Shaders﻿, same gameplay experience with reduced graphics for smoother play on lower-end systems

- **Quest Mods:**  
  TOT includes a massive lineup of lore-rich, fully patched quests that expand Skyrim’s world with new factions, dungeons, and narratives. Major entries include:  
  - Legacy of the Dragonborn, The Forgotten City, VIGILANT, Project AHO, Wyrmstooth, Glenmoril, Unslaad, Carved Brink, The Tools of Kagrenac, The Gray Cowl of Nocturnal, Sirenroot, Olenveld, DaCoda, Moon and Star, Legends of Aetherium, Heart of the Reach, Ascend, Sleepwalking into a Nightmare — and many more.

- **Combat:**  
  Features Elden Ring movesets, optional WoLong movesets, full BFCO integration, and a suite of enemy balance and difficulty tweaks. The combat system supports a challenging but fair experience where any playstyle is viable—battlemage, stealth archer, heavy melee, dual wield, and more. 

- **City and World Overhauls:**  
  Fully integrated combinations of JK’s Skyrim, Cities of the North, and The Great Cities series — all patched for terrain, navmesh, AI paths, and visual consistency.

- **Armor & Weapon Add-ons:**  
  Includes a wide range of high-quality, lore-friendly armors and weapons curated for visual consistency and seamless distribution across leveled lists.

- **Comprehensive NPC Overhauls:**  
  Nearly every NPC in Skyrim has been visually enhanced using a curated blend of ColdSun’s Visions, Pandorables NPCs, Sons of Nirn, and other top-quality overhaul mods — all seamlessly integrated through a custom EasyNPC merge for maximum compatibility and consistency.

## 🔥 Installation Instructions

### 🧱 System Dependencies

Before continuing, make sure these system components are installed — they are required for Wabbajack and Skyrim to function correctly:

- [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework)

If you're unsure whether these are already installed, it's safe to install them again — they will update or repair as needed.

---

### ❗ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you meet the following **hard requirements**:

- **You must own and install Skyrim Anniversary Edition (AE).**  
  The Standard Special Edition (SSE) will not work — this modlist requires the full AE version with all Creation Club content.

- **You must have the Creation Kit installed via Steam.**  
  It is required for the modlist to compile and **must be installed on the same drive** as your Skyrim AE installation.  
  > Example: If Skyrim AE is installed on `D:\`, the Creation Kit must also be installed on `D:\`.

- **Installation must be on an SSD.**  
  Installing to an HDD will result in long load times, freezing, and crashes.

---

### 🧰 Installation Steps

1. **Download Wabbajack**  
   Get the latest version of Wabbajack from [https://www.wabbajack.org/](https://www.wabbajack.org/)

2. **Prepare a Clean Skyrim AE Installation**  
   🎥 *All of the steps below are shown in this video:*  
   [GamerPoets – Clean Skyrim Setup Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1QyAj4c564&ab_channel=GamerPoets)

   - Uninstall any existing Skyrim installation via Steam.
   - Navigate to `Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition` and delete all contents (back up if desired).
   - Reinstall **Skyrim Anniversary Edition** via Steam.
   - **Launch Skyrim AE once through Steam** to allow all Creation Club content to download.  
     Do **not** change any settings or start a game — just reach the main menu, download the Creation Kit content via the popup, then close it.
   - - Install the **Skyrim Special Edition Creation Kit** from the *Tools* section in your Steam Library.  
        ✅ Make sure it’s installed on the **same drive** as Skyrim AE.  
        ⚠️ **Do not install the regular Skyrim Creation Kit** — it is not compatible and will not work with this modlist.
   - **Launch the Creation Kit once** to initialize its content, allow it to complete downloading, then close it.  

3. **Launch Wabbajack**
   - Open Wabbajack.
   - Click the **Modlists Browser** tab.
   - In the **upper-left corner**, enable:
     - ✅ **Show Unofficial Lists**
   - Use the search bar to find **Tomes of Talos**.

4. **Select the Modlist**
   - Click on **Tomes of Talos**.
   - Choose:
     - A **Download Location** – where Wabbajack will store mod archives (can be on any drive).  
           📦 Requires approximately **241 GB of free space**.

     - An **Installation Location** – where the modlist will be fully installed and run from.  
           💾 Requires approximately **436 GB of free space**.  
           ⚠️ **This must be on an SSD** for performance and stability.

5. **Start Installation**
   - Click **Start** to begin the automated installation.
   - Wabbajack will handle the process automatically. If any files fail to download (e.g., Nexus permissions), Wabbajack will prompt you to log in or download manually.

6. **Having Issues? Run Through This Checklist First**  
If Wabbajack is refusing to download or install the modlist, double-check the following **before requesting support**:

- ❓ Did you completely clean your system of all traces of Skyrim before beginning?
- ✅ Are you using a **fresh install** of **Skyrim Anniversary Edition**?
- 🔓 Did you **launch Skyrim once through Steam** to allow all Creation Club content to download?
- 🧰 Did you install the **Skyrim Special Edition Creation Kit** via Steam on the **same drive** as your Skyrim install?
- 🟢 Did you **launch the Skyrim Special Edition Creation Kit once** to initialize its required files?
- 💾 Do you have enough **free space** on your installation drive?
- 🌐 Are you **logged into NexusMods** with a **Premium membership**?
- 🔁 Have you retried the download at least **3 times**? Sometimes Wabbajack errors are temporary and resolve on their own.

> If you’ve gone through the full checklist and are still stuck, feel free to ask for help in the [Scrolls of Schtevie Discord](https://discord.gg/WuJe7CXpCZ)


## ✅ Post-Installation Steps

Once Wabbajack finishes, you're not quite ready to jump in yet — follow these steps carefully to finalize your setup.

---

### 1. **Open MO2**

- Navigate to your **Tomes of Talos installation folder**.
- Launch **ModOrganizer.exe** (MO2) from that directory.

---

### 2. **Select Your Profile (and Stick With It)**

Tomes of Talos includes **two distinct profiles**, each preconfigured with its own settings, tool outputs, and game experience.  
You can select your profile from the **dropdown in the upper-left corner of MO2** (just above the mod pane).

| Profile Name                | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Lord’s Vision**           | Cabbage ENB﻿, Full graphics, and all features enabled                        |
| **Performance**             | Community Shaders﻿, same gameplay experience with reduced graphics for smoother play on lower-end systems       |

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Once you choose a profile, **stick with it**.  
> Do **not** switch between profiles mid-playthrough. Each profile uses its own:
> - Mod configurations  
> - MCM settings  
> - Tool outputs (DynDOLOD, TexGen, BodySlide, etc.)  
> - Save file directories  
>
> **Save files are not cross-compatible.** Switching profiles mid-playthrough can break your game or result in corrupted saves.

---

### 3. **Set the Executable and Launch the Game**

- Ensure **`Tomes of Talos`** is selected as the modlist in the **top-right executable dropdown** in MO2.
- Click **Run** to start the game.

---

### 🛠️ Additional Notes

- 🗣️ **Language:** Your Skyrim installation **must be set to English**  
  → [How to change Skyrim’s language](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/651/~/how-do-i-change-the-language-in-skyrim%3F)
- 💾 **Storage:** The full installation requires approximately **707 GB of space**

## 🧠 Getting Started Guide

Before diving into your playthrough, take a moment to configure the list to match your setup. Whether you're using ultrawide resolutions or a controller, Tomes of Talos is built to adapt — but it expects you to pick your setup and stick with it.

---

### 🖥️ Widescreen & Resolution Support

Tomes of Talos includes full widescreen support with UI presets for all major aspect ratios. These options are found near the **bottom of MO2** under the **`Resolution Presets`** separator (highlighted in blue).

- **✅ Always enabled:**
  - `TOT - Core UI`

- **Choose one (and only one) based on your monitor:**
  - `TOT - 21x9 UI Patch` → for ultrawide (21:9)
  - `TOT - 32x9 UI Patch` → for super ultrawide (32:9)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1769223b-4126-49ea-b934-ad37a91590c0)


> Do not enable multiple resolution patches. Choose the one that fits your monitor setup.

---

### 🎮 Controller Support (Optional)

Controller support is fully integrated into TOT — but all related mods are **disabled by default** so players can opt in manually. To enable controller support:

1. Scroll to the **`Controller Support`** separator in MO2 (highlighted in blue).
2. **Enable all of the following mods**:
   - `Gamepad++`
   - `Wheeler - Quick Action Wheel Of Skyrim`
   - `Wheeler CTD-Fix`
   - `Dragonborn - Wheeler Reskin`
   - `Dragonborn - Wheeler Reskin Edge UI Colors`
   - `Complete Controller Setup`
  
<img width="332" height="201" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d15ae2a-3acd-4688-ad12-4e13a766b3d6" />

3. In the **right-side plugin pane**, locate the following plugins and drag them into the correct plugin groups:
   - `Gamepad++` → move to the **User Interface** group
   - `Complete Controller Setup` → move to the **Master Plugins** group

> ⚠️ Incorrect plugin group assignment can cause controller-related bugs or interface issues.

Once enabled and properly sorted, you’ll have full access to enhanced controller features including radial wheels, custom stances, and a gamepad-friendly UI.
