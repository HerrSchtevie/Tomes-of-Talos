The downloads can be removed after successful installation. NOT RECOMMENDED. But if you're short on space, it won't cause issues.

---

## üî• Installation Instructions

### üß± System Dependencies

Before continuing, make sure these system components are installed ‚Äî they are required for Wabbajack and Skyrim to function correctly:

- [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework)

If you're unsure whether these are already installed, it's safe to install them again ‚Äî they will update or repair as needed.

---

### ‚ùó Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you meet the following **hard requirements**:

- **You must own and install Skyrim Anniversary Edition (AE).**  
  The Standard Special Edition (SSE) will not work ‚Äî this modlist requires the full AE version with all Creation Club content.

- **You must have the Creation Kit installed via Steam.**  
  It is required for the modlist to compile and **must be installed on the same drive** as your Skyrim AE installation.  
  > Example: If Skyrim AE is installed on `D:\`, the Creation Kit must also be installed on `D:\`.

- **Installation must be on an SSD.**  
  Installing to an HDD will result in long load times, freezing, and crashes.

---

### üß∞ Installation Steps

1. **Download Wabbajack**  
   Get the latest version of Wabbajack from [https://www.wabbajack.org/](https://www.wabbajack.org/)

2. **Prepare a Clean Skyrim AE Installation**  
   üé• *All of the steps below are shown in this video:*  
   [GamerPoets ‚Äì Clean Skyrim Setup Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1QyAj4c564&ab_channel=GamerPoets)

   - Uninstall any existing Skyrim installation via Steam.
   - Navigate to `Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition` and delete all contents (back up if desired).
   - Reinstall **Skyrim Anniversary Edition** via Steam.
   - **Launch Skyrim AE once through Steam** to allow all Creation Club content to download.  
     Do **not** change any settings or start a game ‚Äî just reach the main menu, download the Creation Kit content via the popup, then close it.
   - - Install the **Skyrim Special Edition Creation Kit** from the *Tools* section in your Steam Library.  
        ‚úÖ Make sure it‚Äôs installed on the **same drive** as Skyrim AE.  
        ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not install the regular Skyrim Creation Kit** ‚Äî it is not compatible and will not work with this modlist.
   - **Launch the Creation Kit once** to initialize its content, allow it to complete downloading, then close it.  

3. **Launch Wabbajack**
   - Open Wabbajack.
   - Click the **Modlists Browser** tab.
   - In the **upper-left corner**, enable:
     - ‚úÖ **Show Unofficial Lists**
   - Use the search bar to find **Tomes of Talos**.

4. **Select the Modlist**
   - Click on **Tomes of Talos**.
   - Choose:
     - A **Download Location** ‚Äì where Wabbajack will store mod archives (can be on any drive).  
           üì¶ Requires approximately **241 GB of free space**.

     - An **Installation Location** ‚Äì where the modlist will be fully installed and run from.  
           üíæ Requires approximately **436 GB of free space**.  
           ‚ö†Ô∏è **This must be on an SSD** for performance and stability.

5. **Start Installation**
   - Click **Start** to begin the automated installation.
   - Wabbajack will handle the process automatically. If any files fail to download (e.g., Nexus permissions), Wabbajack will prompt you to log in or download manually.

---

6. **Having Issues? Run Through This Checklist First**  
If Wabbajack is refusing to download or install the modlist, double-check the following **before requesting support**:

- ‚ùì Did you completely clean your system of all traces of Skyrim before beginning?
- ‚úÖ Are you using a **fresh install** of **Skyrim Anniversary Edition**?
- üîì Did you **launch Skyrim once through Steam** to allow all Creation Club content to download?
- üß∞ Did you install the **Skyrim Special Edition Creation Kit** via Steam on the **same drive** as your Skyrim install?
- üü¢ Did you **launch the Skyrim Special Edition Creation Kit once** to initialize its required files?
- üíæ Do you have enough **free space** on your installation drive?
- üåê Are you **logged into NexusMods** with a **Premium membership**?
- üîÅ Have you retried the download at least **3 times**? Sometimes Wabbajack errors are temporary and resolve on their own.

> If you‚Äôve gone through the full checklist and are still stuck, feel free to ask for help in the [Scrolls of Schtevie Discord](https://discord.gg/WuJe7CXpCZ)


## ‚úÖ Post-Installation Steps

Once Wabbajack finishes, you're not quite ready to jump in yet ‚Äî follow these steps carefully to finalize your setup.

---

### 1. **Open MO2**

- Navigate to your **Tomes of Talos installation folder**.
- Launch **ModOrganizer.exe** (MO2) from that directory.

---

### 2. **Select Your Profile (and Stick With It)**

Tomes of Talos includes **two distinct profiles**, each preconfigured with its own settings, tool outputs, and game experience.  
You can select your profile from the **dropdown in the upper-left corner of MO2** (just above the mod pane).

| Profile Name                | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Lord‚Äôs Vision**           | Cabbage ENBÔªø, Full graphics, and all features enabled                        |
| **Performance**             | Community ShadersÔªø, same gameplay experience with reduced graphics for smoother play on lower-end systems       |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Once you choose a profile, **stick with it**.  
> Do **not** switch between profiles mid-playthrough. Each profile uses its own:
> - Mod configurations  
> - MCM settings  
> - Tool outputs (DynDOLOD, TexGen, BodySlide, etc.)  
> - Save file directories  
>
> **Save files are not cross-compatible.** Switching profiles mid-playthrough can break your game or result in corrupted saves.

---

### 3. **Set the Executable and Launch the Game**

- Ensure **`Tomes of Talos`** is selected as the modlist in the **top-right executable dropdown** in MO2.
- Click **Run** to start the game.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Additional Notes

- üó£Ô∏è **Language:** Your Skyrim installation **must be set to English**  
  ‚Üí [How to change Skyrim‚Äôs language](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/651/~/how-do-i-change-the-language-in-skyrim%3F)
- üíæ **Storage:** The full installation requires approximately **707 GB of space**

## üß† Getting Started Guide

Before diving into your playthrough, take a moment to configure the list to match your setup. Whether you're using ultrawide resolutions or a controller, Tomes of Talos is built to adapt ‚Äî but it expects you to pick your setup and stick with it.

---

### üñ•Ô∏è Widescreen & Resolution Support

Tomes of Talos includes full widescreen support with UI presets for all major aspect ratios. These options are found near the **bottom of MO2** under the **`Resolution Presets`** separator (highlighted in blue).

- **‚úÖ Always enabled:**
  - `TOT - Core UI`

- **Choose one (and only one) based on your monitor:**
  - `TOT - 21x9 UI Patch` ‚Üí for ultrawide (21:9)
  - `TOT - 32x9 UI Patch` ‚Üí for super ultrawide (32:9)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1769223b-4126-49ea-b934-ad37a91590c0)


> Do not enable multiple resolution patches. Choose the one that fits your monitor setup.

---

### üéÆ Controller Support (Optional)

Controller support is fully integrated into TOT ‚Äî but all related mods are **disabled by default** so players can opt in manually. To enable controller support:

1. Scroll to the **`Controller Support`** separator in MO2 (highlighted in blue).
2. **Enable all of the following mods**:
   - `Gamepad++`
   - `Wheeler - Quick Action Wheel Of Skyrim`
   - `Wheeler CTD-Fix`
   - `Dragonborn - Wheeler Reskin`
   - `Dragonborn - Wheeler Reskin Edge UI Colors`
   - `Complete Controller Setup`

3. In the **right-side plugin pane**, locate the following plugins and drag them into the correct plugin groups:
   - `Gamepad++` ‚Üí move to the **User Interface** group
   - `Complete Controller Setup` ‚Üí move to the **Master Plugins** group

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Incorrect plugin group assignment can cause controller-related bugs or interface issues.

Once enabled and properly sorted, you‚Äôll have full access to enhanced controller features including radial wheels, custom stances, and a gamepad-friendly UI.
